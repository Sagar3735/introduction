          <p>
             Cascading style sheet, fondly refored to as CSS, is a simply designed language intend to simplyfy
             the process of making web pages presentable. CSS enable  you to do this independently of the HTML
             that makes up each web page. It describe how a webpage should look. It prescribe colors, fonts, 
             spacing and much more. In short you can make your website look however you want. CSS lets 
             developers and designers define how it behaves, including how elements are positioned in the 
             browser.<br />
             while HTML uses tags, CSS uses nullsets. CSS is easy to learn and understand,  but it provides
             powerful control over the presentation of an HTML document.

        <h2>
        <li>Javascript :</li>
        </h2>

           <p>  Javascript is a lightweight, cross-platform, single-threaded and innterpreted compile programming 
             language. It is also known as the scripting language for webpages. It is well known for the
             development of web pages, and many non brwser environment also use it.<br />
             Javascript is a weakly typer language(dynamically typed). Javascript can be used for client-side
             developments. Javascript contains a standard library of objects, like Array, Data and Math, and a 
             core set of language elements like operator, control structure and statements.
           </p>

            <ul>
              <h4>
                <li> client side :</li>
              </h4> 

               <p>It  supplies objects to control a browser and its Documents Object Model (DOM). Like if client-side
                  extension allow an aplication to place elements on an HTML form.</p> 

              <h4>
                <li>Server-side :</li>

                 allow an application to communicate with a database.</p>

              <h4>
                <li>Imperative Language :</li>
              </h4>

              <p>In this type of language we are smothly concerned about how it is to be done. It simply controls
                the flow of the computation.</p>
            </ul>
